#Singly Linked Lists (Part II)

Singly linked lists are data structures in which a node only links to the next in the sequence. Data is stored in one node and the other node contains a pointer to the next element's node.

Structure (non-diagrammatical representation)
data - ptr -> data - ptr -> Null(end of the linked list)
